# Node Task Manager API

This project was created with the intetion of learning more about API construction in nodejs.

The frontend of the project was created only for being able to visually interact with the API, but the focus on this code is on the backend part.

It was deployed using railway, which only allows the project to be live for 20 days per month. So, you problably won't be able to access it between something like from the 20th to the 30th day of each month.

All the feebacks will be listen.
